A friendly, MQTT-driven scene renderer for Divoom Pixoo 64 devices, written in
Node.js. It listens to MQTT messages, manages scenes, and renders pixels with a
focus on clean architecture and helpful, positive logs.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Central Scheduler**: One loop per device; scenes are pure renderers and return
  a next delay (ms) or `null` when complete.
- **Per-Device State Machine**: Tracks `currentScene`, `generationId`, and
  `status` (switching/running) for robust scene switching.
- **Pure-Render Scenes**: No scene-owned timers or MQTT; timing and gating are
  handled centrally.
- **MQTT Control**: Full control per device (scene selection, driver switching,
  resets) and metrics.
- **Observability**: Publishes `/home/pixoo/<ip>/scene/state` with version,
  build number, git commit for traceability.
- **Hot-Swappable Drivers**: Switch between `real` HTTP driver and `mock` driver
  on the fly.
- **Advanced Renderers**: High-quality renderers for charts, gradients, and
  smooth animations.
- **Smart Boot Handling**: Detects freshly booted devices and handles them
  gracefully.
- **Structured Logging**: Clean, informative logs with helpful context.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Node.js 18+, an MQTT broker, and a Pixoo 64 on your network.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markus-barta/pixoo-daemon.git
cd pixoo-daemon
npm install

# Configure your MQTT credentials and device IPs in a .env file (see .env.example)
# Or set environment variables manually.

npm start
```

Send your first command (replace the IP with your device's):

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h $MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24 -u $MOSQITTO_USER_MS24 -P $MOSQITTO_PASS_MS24 -t "pixoo/192.168.1.159/state/upd" -m '{"scene":"startup"}'
```
