A friendly, MQTT-driven scene renderer for Divoom Pixoo 64 devices, written in
Node.js. It listens to MQTT messages, manages scenes, and renders pixels with a
focus on clean architecture and helpful, positive logs.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Scene Management**: Robust scene lifecycle with `init`, `render`, and `cleanup` hooks.
- **MQTT Control**: Full control per device, including scene selection, driver switching, and metrics.
- **Hot-Swappable Drivers**: Switch between a `real` HTTP driver and a `mock` driver on the fly.
- **Advanced Renderers**: Includes high-quality renderers for charts and gradients.
- **Smart Boot Handling**: Automatically detects freshly booted devices and handles them gracefully.
- **Structured Logging**: Clean, informative logs with a positive tone.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Node.js 18+, an MQTT broker, and a Pixoo 64 on your network.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markus-barta/pixoo-daemon.git
cd pixoo-daemon
npm install

# Configure your MQTT credentials and device IPs in a .env file (see .env.example)
# Or set environment variables manually.

npm start
```

Send your first command (replace the IP with your device's):

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h $MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24 -u $MOSQITTO_USER_MS24 -P $MOSQITTO_PASS_MS24 -t "pixoo/192.168.1.159/state/upd" -m '{"scene":"startup"}'
```
