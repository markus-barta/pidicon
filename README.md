Pixoo Daemon is a friendly, MQTT-driven scene renderer for the Divoom Pixoo 64.
It listens to MQTT messages, manages scenes, and renders pixels with an upbeat
vibe and a professional, production-ready architecture.

**üöÄ v2.0.0 - Stable Release**: Complete architectural overhaul with senior-level code quality,
professional error handling, and enterprise-grade robustness. Features centralized scheduling,
pixel-perfect text rendering, and maximum code reusability.

Think: clean code, smart scheduling, rock-solid scene switching, and beautiful
visuals ‚Äì all under your control with a few simple MQTT messages.

---

## ‚ú® Highlights

- **Centralized Scheduler**: One device loop per Pixoo; scenes are pure
  renderers that return a delay (ms) or `null` to finish.
- **Per-Device State Machine**: Authoritative `currentScene`, `targetScene`,
  `generationId`, and `status` mirrored to MQTT for observability.
- **Pure-Render Contract**: Scenes do not own timers or publish MQTT. No
  zombies, no stale frames.
- **Input Gating**: Stale animation frames are ignored if scene/generation do
  not match ‚Äì because correctness matters.
- **Hot-Swappable Drivers**: Switch between `real` HTTP and lightning-fast
  `mock` drivers on the fly.
- **Observability Built-In**: Publishes `/home/pixoo/<ip>/scene/state` with
  build metadata for traceable runs.
- **Advanced Renderers**: High-quality charting, gradients, and smooth
  animation primitives.
- **Structured Logging**: Clear, cheerful logs with context (`ok`, `info`,
  `warn`, `error`).

## üß† Architecture Overview

- **Centralized Per-Device Scheduler**: A single loop per device drives all
  loop-enabled scenes. Scenes signal cadence by returning a number (ms), and
  signal completion by returning `null`.
- **Per-Device State Machine**: Each device tracks `currentScene`,
  `generationId`, and `status` (`switching` ‚Üí `running`). The authoritative
  state is available to scenes and mirrored to MQTT.
- **Pure-Render Contract**: Scenes never own timers or publish MQTT messages
  for "next frame". This eliminates race conditions and stale updates.
- **Input Gating**: Messages tagged as animation frames are dropped unless they
  match the active `(scene, generation)`. No more zombie frames.
- **Hot Drivers**: Swap between `real` (HTTP) and `mock` drivers without
  restarting. Great for local development and CI.

For a deeper dive into the scene interface and responsibilities, see
`scenes/README.md` and `STANDARDS.md`.

## üé® Scenes

Core scenes:

- `startup`: Build and version info on boot.
- `empty`: Clears the display.
- `fill`: Solid color fill.
- `advanced_chart`: A dynamic, well-styled chart renderer.

Examples:

- `draw_api`: Showcases the drawing API primitives.
- `draw_api_animated`: Rich animation demo with FPS/ms overlay. Supports
  optional `interval` and `frames`.
- `performance-test`: Finite or adaptive benchmarking with beautiful
  gradients and a centered "COMPLETE" overlay.

All animated scenes declare `wantsLoop: true` and follow the pure-render
contract by returning either a next delay or `null`.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, an MQTT broker, and a Pixoo 64 on your network.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markus-barta/pixoo-daemon.git
cd pixoo-daemon
npm install

# Set environment variables (examples below) and then start
npm start
```

Send your first command (replace IP):

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h $MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24 -u $MOSQITTO_USER_MS24 -P $MOSQITTO_PASS_MS24 \
  -t "pixoo/192.168.1.159/state/upd" -m '{"scene":"startup"}'
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Environment variables (recommended to set via your shell or `.env`):

- `MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24` / `MOSQITTO_USER_MS24` / `MOSQITTO_PASS_MS24`:
  MQTT connection.
- `PIXOO_DEVICE_TARGETS`: Mapping of device IPs to drivers. Example:
  `192.168.1.159=real;192.168.1.189=mock`.
- `PIXOO_DEFAULT_DRIVER`: Fallback driver (`real` or `mock`).
- `SCENE_STATE_TOPIC_BASE`: Base topic for scene state (default `/home/pixoo`).

Tip: During development, the mock driver is fast and conflict-free. Use the
real driver when you want to see pixels on your device.

---

## üì° MQTT Topics & Commands

The daemon listens to device-scoped commands like `pixoo/<ip>/state/upd`. It
also publishes scene state to `/home/pixoo/<ip>/scene/state` (configurable).

Starter commands:

```bash
# Clear screen
mosquitto_pub -h $MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24 -u $MOSQITTO_USER_MS24 -P $MOSQITTO_PASS_MS24 \
  -t "pixoo/192.168.1.159/state/upd" -m '{"scene":"empty"}'

# Fill red
mosquitto_pub -h $MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24 -u $MOSQITTO_USER_MS24 -P $MOSQITTO_PASS_MS24 \
  -t "pixoo/192.168.1.159/state/upd" -m '{"scene":"fill","color":[255,0,0,255]}'

# Animated demo (indefinite)
mosquitto_pub -h $MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24 -u $MOSQITTO_USER_MS24 -P $MOSQITTO_PASS_MS24 \
  -t "pixoo/192.168.1.159/state/upd" -m '{"scene":"draw_api_animated"}'

# Animated demo (adaptive, 64 frames)
mosquitto_pub -h $MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24 -u $MOSQITTO_USER_MS24 -P $MOSQITTO_PASS_MS24 \
  -t "pixoo/192.168.1.159/state/upd" -m '{"scene":"draw_api_animated","frames":64}'

# Performance test (fixed 150ms, 100 frames)
mosquitto_pub -h $MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24 -u $MOSQITTO_USER_MS24 -P $MOSQITTO_PASS_MS24 \
  -t "pixoo/192.168.1.159/state/upd" -m '{"scene":"performance-test","interval":150,"frames":100}'
```

For the full list, see `MQTT_COMMANDS.md`.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Local Development

- Scripts:
  - `npm start`: run the daemon
  - `npm run build:version`: update `version.json`
  - `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix`: ESLint
  - `npm run md:lint` / `npm run md:fix`: Markdownlint

- Scene interface (pure-render contract):

```javascript
'use strict';

module.exports = {
  name: 'my_scene',
  wantsLoop: true, // animated scenes opt in; static scenes set false
  async init(ctx) {
    // one-time setup
  },
  async render(ctx) {
    const { device } = ctx;
    // draw your frame...
    await device.push('my_scene', ctx.publishOk);

    // return next delay in ms (loop-driven) or null to finish
    return 0; // schedule next frame ASAP
  },
  async cleanup(ctx) {
    // free resources; keep it idempotent
  },
};
```

---

## ‚úÖ Testing & Live Recipes

We provide mock tests and live helpers in `scripts/`:

- `scripts/live_test_harness.js`: quick scene cycle smoke test
- `scripts/live_test_gate.js`: verifies stale frame gating
- `scripts/live_test_perf_once.js`: single finite perf run
- `scripts/live_test_perf_repeat.js`: consecutive perf runs
- `scripts/live_test_draw_animated.js [frames]`: run animated demo; if
  `frames >= 0` it stops and shows a centered "COMPLETE" overlay

Use the mock driver whenever possible. When testing live, confirm the device is
free and that the build/commit on the device matches your local before you run
tests (see `STANDARDS.md` "Live Server Testing Protocol").

---

## üëÄ Observability

Scene state is published to:

- `${SCENE_STATE_TOPIC_BASE}/<ip>/scene/state` (default `/home/pixoo`)

Payload keys include `currentScene`, `targetScene`, `status`, `generationId`,
`version`, `buildNumber`, `gitCommit`, and `ts`. You can watch these to confirm
the right build is live before running tests.

Each successful `push()` also emits `pixoo/<ip>/ok` with per-frame metrics.

---

## üìù Changelog

- v1.1
  - Centralized scheduler and pure-render scenes
  - Input gating for stale frames; per-device state mirrored to MQTT
  - Performance scene improvements; animated demo with frames cap and completion
  - Expanded docs (README, MQTT commands) and live test scripts

Older history lives in commits and `docs/BACKLOG.md` with build/commit evidence.

---

## ‚ùì FAQ

- **Why do scenes return a number or `null`?**
  - Returning a number (ms) tells the central scheduler when to render the next
    frame. Returning `null` signals completion so the loop stops cleanly.

- **Can scenes manage their own timers or publish next-frame MQTT?**
  - No. That would break the pure-render contract and reintroduce race
    conditions. The central loop does the timing; scenes focus on pixels.

- **How are stale frames avoided?**
  - Input gating drops animation-frame messages whose `(scene, generation)` do
    not match the active device state. Old scenes cannot affect the screen.

- **Can I run multiple devices?**
  - Yes. Each device has its own state machine and scheduler loop; devices are
    fully isolated.

- **How do I create a new scene?**
  - Copy `scenes/template.js` and customize it. Follow the pure-render contract:
    return a delay (ms) for animated scenes or `null` for static scenes.

- **Why is my scene not updating?**
  - Check that you're calling `await device.push()` after drawing.
  - Verify your scene exports the correct interface: `name`, `render`, `init`, `cleanup`, `wantsLoop`.
  - Ensure `wantsLoop: true` for animated scenes that need regular updates.

- **How do I debug scene issues?**
  - Enable debug logging: `LOG_LEVEL=debug npm start`
  - Check MQTT messages: `mosquitto_sub -h $MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24 -t 'pixoo/+/#'`
  - Use the mock driver for faster development: `PIXOO_DEVICE_TARGETS="192.168.1.159=mock"`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Scene Not Loading**

- **Symptoms**: Scene not appearing in logs or not responding to MQTT commands
- **Causes**:
  - Missing required exports (`name`, `render`)
  - Syntax errors in scene file
  - Incorrect file permissions
- **Solutions**:
  - Check logs for registration messages: `Scene registered: your_scene_name`
  - Validate scene interface with `npm run lint`
  - Ensure scene file ends with `.js` extension

#### **MQTT Connection Issues**

- **Symptoms**: No MQTT messages being processed
- **Causes**:
  - Incorrect broker configuration
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Authentication problems
- **Solutions**:
  - Verify environment variables: `MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24`, `MOSQITTO_USER_MS24`, `MOSQITTO_PASS_MS24`
  - Test connection: `mosquitto_pub -h $MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24 -t 'test' -m 'hello'`
  - Check firewall settings and port accessibility

#### **Device Communication Problems**

- **Symptoms**: Drawing commands not appearing on device
- **Causes**:
  - Device offline or unreachable
  - Wrong IP address configured
  - Device driver mismatch
- **Solutions**:
  - Ping device: `ping 192.168.1.159`
  - Use mock driver for testing: `PIXOO_DEVICE_TARGETS="192.168.1.159=mock"`
  - Check device is on same network and accessible

#### **Performance Issues**

- **Symptoms**: Slow rendering, high CPU usage, dropped frames
- **Causes**:
  - Complex drawing operations
  - Inefficient scene logic
  - Memory leaks in scene state
- **Solutions**:
  - Profile with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` to identify bottlenecks
  - Use `device.clear()` sparingly - only when needed
  - Implement proper cleanup in scene `cleanup()` function
  - Consider using static scenes (`wantsLoop: false`) when possible

#### **Stale Frame Issues**

- **Symptoms**: Old scenes affecting current display after switching
- **Causes**:
  - Missing cleanup in scene `cleanup()` function
  - State not properly cleared between scene switches
- **Solutions**:
  - Implement proper cleanup: clear timers, reset state variables
  - Use scene state Map for consistent state management
  - Test scene switching: `scripts/live_test_harness.js`

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check daemon logs with debug level
LOG_LEVEL=debug npm start

# Monitor all MQTT traffic
mosquitto_sub -h $MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24 -t 'pixoo/+/#' -v

# Test device connectivity
mosquitto_pub -h $MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24 -u $MOSQITTO_USER_MS24 -P $MOSQITTO_PASS_MS24 \
  -t "pixoo/192.168.1.159/state/upd" -m '{"scene":"empty"}'

# Check device state
mosquitto_sub -h $MOSQITTO_HOST_MS24 -t '/home/pixoo/192.168.1.159/scene/state'

# Test with mock driver
PIXOO_DEVICE_TARGETS="192.168.1.159=mock" npm start
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**: Always start with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` to see detailed information
2. **Test with mock driver**: Use `PIXOO_DEVICE_TARGETS="ip=mock"` to isolate scene logic from device issues
3. **Validate scene interface**: Ensure your scene exports all required functions
4. **Check MQTT topics**: Verify commands are reaching the correct topics
5. **Review scene state**: Use the scene state topic to monitor device state changes

If issues persist, check `docs/BACKLOG.md` for known issues or create a new entry for tracking.
