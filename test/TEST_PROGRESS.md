## Phase 4: Critical Unit Tests ⏳ TODO

- DeviceService unit tests (30 tests)
- SceneService unit tests (25 tests)
- StateStore edge cases (15 tests)

---

## Phase 5: Selective UI Tests ⏳ TODO

**Goal**: Smoke tests only. UI tests are expensive to maintain.

### Planned Tests (18 tests):
- Diagnostics dashboard (8 tests)
- Device controls (5 tests)
- Settings persistence (5 tests)

---

## Phase 6: Performance Benchmarks ⏳ TODO

**Goal**: Establish baselines. Detect regressions, not enforce arbitrary limits.

### Planned Tests (15 tests):
- Latency benchmarks (10 tests)
- Memory leak detection (5 tests)

---

## Test Quality Metrics

### Speed
- **Unit tests**: <100ms average
- **Integration tests**: <1s average
- **Full suite**: ~10s total
- **Target**: <20s for CI

### Reliability
- **Flakiness**: 0% (all tests deterministic)
- **Pass rate**: 100% (246/246 passing)
- **Stability**: No intermittent failures

- **Test Isolation**: 100% (no shared mutable state)
- **Mock Quality**: High (proper dependency injection)
- **Descriptive Names**: 100% (behavior-driven)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2)
1. Create device isolation integration tests
2. Expand watchdog service tests with false positive checks
3. Add driver failure recovery scenarios

### Short Term (Phases 3-4)
4. Lock down MQTT command contracts
5. Lock down REST API contracts
6. Complete DeviceService/SceneService unit tests

### Long Term (Phases 5-6)
7. Add UI smoke tests
8. Establish performance baselines
