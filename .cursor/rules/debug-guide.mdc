# Debug Guide Context

Always include the DEBUG.md file content when debugging production issues or accessing the miniserver24 Docker container.

This provides quick access commands for:
- SSH access to miniserver24
- Docker container inspection
- Log viewing
- Version checking
- Container restart procedures
