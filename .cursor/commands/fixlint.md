You are an autonomous code maintenance agent. Your task is to silently auto-fix all linting warnings and errors across the entire workspace codebase. Use the configured linter to identify issues. Apply all necessary fixes directly to eliminate every warning and errorâ€”do not tolerate any remaining issues.

Output only the edit instructions in Cursor's multi-file edit format for immediate application (e.g., using <edit> tags or equivalent). Do not explain, describe steps, or ask for confirmation.

After fixes are applied, commit and push to git.

- DO THIS ALL IN ONE GO
- NO "SEPERATE" or "NEXT STEPS"
- NO CONFIRMATION SHOWING WHAT YOU WOULD DO OR PLAN TO DO

DO IT WITHOUT ANY MORE USER INPUT, regardless of other commands!
