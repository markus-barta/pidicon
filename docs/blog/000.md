# Blog Entry 000 - BMAD Method Installation & Onboarding

**Date:** 2025-11-08 | **Phase:** Initial Setup

---

## 🚀 BMAD Installation

- Installed BMAD method using **brownfield approach**
- Perfect fit for existing project with established structure
- Zero friction with our custom documentation setup
- Seamless integration with existing codebase

## ✨ Onboarding Experience

### What Went Well

- **Excellent onboarding flow** - Clear, structured, professional
- Easy to follow instructions
- No conflicts with existing project structure
- Documentation was comprehensive

### Initial Confusion

- **Not immediately clear how to invoke commands**
  - Learned commands start with `*` (e.g., `*workflow-init`)
  - This wasn't obvious from documentation at first
- **Talking to agent roles was unclear initially**
  - Discovered you can address roles directly in chat (e.g., "@sm", "@dev")
  - No special syntax needed - just natural conversation
  - Would have been helpful to know upfront

### Discovery Process

- Started feeling a bit lost after onboarding
- Experimented with different approaches
- Eventually figured out:
  - Direct role addressing: "Hey @pm, can you..."
  - Command syntax: `*sprint-planning`, `*story-context`, etc.
  - Natural language works best for most interactions

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- **BMAD brownfield approach:** ✅ Excellent for existing projects
- **Documentation clarity:** Could highlight command/role syntax earlier
- **Learning curve:** Gentle - just needed initial experimentation
- **Overall experience:** 9/10 - Would recommend

**Result:** BMAD successfully integrated | Ready to start Sprint 1
