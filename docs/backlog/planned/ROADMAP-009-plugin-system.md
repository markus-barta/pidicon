# ROADMAP-009: Plugin System

**Status**: Not Started | **Priority**: P2 (Future)
**Effort**: 8-12 hours | **Risk**: High (architecture change)

## Goal

Dynamic driver loading and community contributions
**Features**:

- NPM package-based drivers (`pidicon-driver-<device>`)
- Driver registry and discovery
- Automatic driver installation via Web UI
- Driver marketplace (list community drivers)
- Version management and updates
- Security: sandboxed driver execution
  **Architecture**:

```javascript
// Dynamic driver loading
const MyDriver = require('pidicon-driver-mydevice');
deviceAdapter.registerDriver('mydevice', MyDriver);
```

**Community Benefits**:

- Anyone can add device support
- No need to fork PIDICON
- Faster ecosystem growth
- Share drivers on npm
