# UI-601: Scene Editor (P2) ðŸŸ¢

**Status**: Planned | **Priority**: P2 (Advanced feature)
**Effort**: 5-7 days | **Risk**: High

## Problem

Visual scene editor in Web UI for creating/editing scenes without code.
**Features**:

- Visual canvas editor
- Drag-and-drop components
- Live preview
- Parameter editing
- Save to file
- Template library
  **Rationale**: This would be a significant undertaking. Most users comfortable editing JavaScript files.
  Consider only if there's strong demand.
  **Recommendation**: Low priority. Code-based scenes work well for target audience.
