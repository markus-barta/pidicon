# CFG-502: Config API (P2) ✅

**Status**: completed (Build #600s) | **Priority**: P2
**Effort**: Done | **Risk**: Low

## Problem

REST API for device configuration management.
**Implementation**: Already exists in `web/server.js`:

- ✅ `GET /api/config/devices` - List devices
- ✅ `POST /api/config/devices` - Add device
- ✅ `PUT /api/config/devices/:ip` - Update device
- ✅ `DELETE /api/config/devices/:ip` - Remove device
- ✅ Web UI for device management (Settings page)
  **Note**: This was already implemented as part of Phase 9 (Web UI).
