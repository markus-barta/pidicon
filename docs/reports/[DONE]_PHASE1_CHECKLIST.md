## ✅ ARC-303: Consolidate State Management

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE (FULLY INTEGRATED)**

- [x] Create `lib/state-store.js` with StateStore class
- [x] Implement global state management
- [x] Implement per-device state (activeScene, generationId, status)
- [x] Implement per-scene state
- [x] Implement observable state changes (subscribers)
- [x] Write 34 unit tests (34/34 passing)
- [x] Inject StateStore into SceneManager
- [x] **Refactor ALL Map accesses (~30) to use StateStore helpers**
- [x] **Fix key-to-Map-name mapping in helpers**
- [x] **Write 7 integration tests (7/7 passing)**
- [x] **Verify backward compatibility**
- [x] **Test production daemon startup**

**Test Results**: 96/96 tests passing (includes StateStore integration)  
**Refactoring**: ~30 direct Map accesses → 2 helper methods  
**Deliverables**: `lib/state-store.js`, `test/lib/state-store.test.js`, `test/lib/scene-manager-statestore.test.js`

**Critical Bug Fixed**: Maps not created when StateStore injected (caught & fixed in 30 min)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Integration !== Injection**
   - Just adding a parameter doesn't mean it's integrated
   - Need to refactor all call sites to actually use the injected dependency

2. **Test at All Levels**
   - Unit tests caught logic errors
   - Integration tests caught integration issues
   - Production testing caught runtime issues

3. **Fix Forward, Not Backward**
   - When you break something, fix it properly
   - Don't just revert - complete the refactoring

4. **Documentation is Code**
   - Keep docs in sync with implementation
   - Document as you build, not after
