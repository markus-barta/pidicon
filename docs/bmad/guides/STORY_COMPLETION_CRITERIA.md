## Purpose

This document defines clear completion criteria for each stage of story development to ensure consistency, quality, and proper artifact tracking. These criteria emerged from Epic 1 retrospective action item: "Scrum Master to define clear completion criteria."

---

## Story Status Lifecycle

```
backlog → drafted → ready-for-dev → in-progress → review → done
```

---

## 1. Backlog → Drafted

**Completion Criteria:**

- [ ] Story file created in `{project-root}/docs/bmad/stories/`
- [ ] Story ID assigned (e.g., `1.1`, `0.2`)
- [ ] User story statement present ("As a... I want... so that...")
- [ ] Context section with problem statement
- [ ] At least 3 acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Story added to `sprint-status.yaml` with `drafted` status
- [ ] Epic reference present

**Artifacts Required:**

- Story markdown file (`{story-id}-{title}.md`)
- Entry in `sprint-status.yaml`

**Owner:** Scrum Master (SM) or Product Owner (PO)

**Notes:**

- Draft stories are "good enough to start detailed work"
- May have placeholder sections (e.g., "Tasks TBD")
- Does not require full task breakdown

---

## 2. Drafted → Ready for Dev

**Completion Criteria:**

- [ ] All acceptance criteria are testable and complete
- [ ] Tasks/subtasks broken down with estimated duration
- [ ] Owner assigned (developer name confirmed)
- [ ] Dependencies identified and documented
- [ ] Technical notes / architecture considerations present
- [ ] Definition of Done section complete
- [ ] Story reviewed by Product Owner (business value confirmed)
- [ ] Story reviewed by Technical Lead or Architect (feasibility confirmed)
- [ ] Infrastructure requirements identified (if any)
- [ ] Story updated in `sprint-status.yaml` to `ready-for-dev` status

**Artifacts Required:**

- Complete story file with all sections filled
- Updated `sprint-status.yaml`
- (Optional) Architecture diagram if complex
- (Optional) Technical spike results if research was needed

**Owner:** Scrum Master (SM) with PO + Tech Lead review

**Checklist Questions:**

- Can a developer pick this up and start work without asking clarifying questions?
- Are the acceptance criteria clear enough to write tests?
- Do we have all the information needed to implement?
- Are the dependencies identified and ready?

**Notes:**

- This is the gate for sprint commitment
- Stories in `ready-for-dev` can be pulled into sprint planning
- If major questions remain, story goes back to `drafted`

---

## 3. Ready for Dev → In Progress

**Completion Criteria:**

- [ ] Developer has accepted ownership of the story
- [ ] Story context file generated (if using story-context workflow)
- [ ] Story updated in `sprint-status.yaml` to `in-progress` status
- [ ] First commit references story ID in commit message
- [ ] Developer has reviewed all acceptance criteria and tasks
- [ ] Developer has confirmed understanding of Definition of Done

**Artifacts Required:**

- Story context XML (generated by `story-context` workflow)
- Initial commit with story ID reference
- Updated `sprint-status.yaml`

**Owner:** Developer (Dev)

**Notes:**

- Only one story per developer should be `in-progress` at a time (focus)
- If story is blocked, update status and document blocker
- Sprint board should reflect this status

---

## 4. In Progress → Review

**Completion Criteria:**

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met (validated by developer)
- [ ] All tasks completed (checkboxes in story file checked)
- [ ] Code implemented and committed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests written and passing (if applicable)
- [ ] E2E tests written and passing (if applicable)
- [ ] Code linting passing (no errors)
- [ ] Documentation updated (inline comments, architecture docs, user guides)
- [ ] Pull request created (if using PR workflow)
- [ ] Story "Dev Agent Record" section filled out:
  - Agent model used
  - Files created/modified list
  - Completion notes
  - Debug log references (if applicable)
- [ ] Story updated in `sprint-status.yaml` to `review` status
- [ ] Self-review completed by developer

**Artifacts Required:**

- Implemented code
- Tests (unit, integration, E2E as applicable)
- Updated story file with Dev Agent Record filled
- Pull request (or equivalent)
- Updated `sprint-status.yaml`

**Owner:** Developer (Dev)

**Notes:**

- "Review" means code review + acceptance testing
- If review finds issues, story goes back to `in-progress`
- Developer should validate all ACs before moving to review

---

## 5. Review → Done

**Completion Criteria:**

- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] All review comments addressed
- [ ] Acceptance testing completed by QA or PO
- [ ] All acceptance criteria validated in actual environment
- [ ] Performance impact validated (if applicable)
- [ ] No regressions introduced (existing tests still passing)
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and approved
- [ ] Story "Definition of Done" checklist fully checked
- [ ] Code merged to main branch (if using PR workflow)
- [ ] Deployed to staging or production (as appropriate)
- [ ] Story updated in `sprint-status.yaml` to `done` status
- [ ] Story "Change Log" updated with completion date

**Artifacts Required:**

- Approved code review
- Passing acceptance tests
- Updated story file with all DoD items checked
- Deployment confirmation
- Updated `sprint-status.yaml`

**Owner:** Scrum Master (SM) confirms all criteria met

**Reviewers:** Code review by peer dev, acceptance testing by QA/PO

**Notes:**

- "Done" means shippable and deployed
- If story spans multiple sprints, document clearly in change log
- Celebrate done stories! 🎉

---

## Special Status: Blocked

**When to Use:**

Use `blocked` status when a story cannot proceed due to external dependencies.

**Completion Criteria to Unblock:**

- [ ] Blocker identified and documented in story file
- [ ] Blocker tracked in sprint-status.yaml or separate issues log
- [ ] Blocker owner assigned (who will resolve it)
- [ ] Estimated time to resolution documented
- [ ] Alternative workaround explored (if possible)

**Owner:** Scrum Master (SM) tracks blockers and escalates

**Notes:**

- Blocked stories should be discussed daily in standup
- If blocker cannot be resolved quickly, story goes back to backlog
- Document the blocker clearly for future reference

---

## Epic-Level Completion

**Epic is "Done" when:**

- [ ] All stories in epic are `done`
- [ ] Epic retrospective completed
- [ ] Retrospective documented in `docs/bmad/retrospectives/`
- [ ] Epic success criteria met (defined in epic file)
- [ ] Epic updated in `sprint-status.yaml` to `done`
- [ ] (Optional) Epic demo/showcase to stakeholders
- [ ] Lessons learned captured

---

## Story Artifact Checklist

**Every story file should have these sections:**

1. ✅ Story header (ID, Epic, Status, Priority, Points, Sprint, Owner)
2. ✅ User story statement
3. ✅ Context (problem statement, business value)
4. ✅ Acceptance Criteria (AC1, AC2, ...)
5. ✅ Tasks/Subtasks (with duration estimates)
6. ✅ Dev Notes (architecture, technical considerations)
7. ✅ Definition of Done (DoD checklist)
8. ✅ Dev Agent Record (model used, files changed, completion notes)
9. ✅ Change Log (who changed what when)
10. ✅ References (epic, related stories, technical docs)

## Process Improvements

This document should be treated as a living guide. If you find gaps or ambiguities:

1. Discuss in retrospective
2. Update this document
3. Increment version number
4. Communicate changes to team

**Feedback:** Bring process improvement ideas to Bob (SM) or raise in retrospective.
