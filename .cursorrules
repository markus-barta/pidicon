## Communication and Feedback

### Build and Deployment References

When mentioning Watchtower deployment or that changes will be deployed, **ALWAYS** include both:
1. The git commit hash (short form, 7 characters)
2. The expected build number

**Example:**
> "Pushed to main in commit `f8cbaad` (Build #554). Watchtower will deploy it shortly! ðŸš€"

**NOT:**
> "Watchtower will deploy it shortly!"

**How to get the build number:**
- The build number equals the git commit count: `git rev-list --count HEAD`
- Run this command after pushing to get the exact build number
- Note: `version.json` is only updated during Docker builds, not on local commits

**Rationale:** This helps the user quickly identify which build to expect on the server
and correlate it with the deployment logs and Web UI build information.
